    "A relation implicitly describes a [bipartite graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph). This means the relation maps a distinct set of elements in A to a distinct set of elements in B and there are no relations between elements of the same set. In graph form, the elements of both sets A and B are treated as vertices, or nodes, in the graph.  The relation R is represented as the edges connecting those nodes.\n",

    "A graph can be conveniently represented as an adjacency matrix. Adjacency matricies are square.  The rows and columns represent the full set of vertices in the graph and the cell values describe the edges between them.  A binary value {0,1} represents connectivity, the presense or absense of an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representing a relation as a graph means treating the combined elements of sets A and B as the vertices of the graph.  In the above relation the three elements of set A and four elements of set B combine to create seven graph verticies. This results in a 7x7 matrix with cells populated based on the edges connecting the vertices. To fit with the adjacency matrix structure, we will keep set elements of A as {1, 2, 3} and rename the elements of set B as {4, 5, 6, 7}.  The relation remains the same, we are just keeping the element \"names\" distinct across the sets to make it easier to work with them as distinct vertices of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjacency matrix is square because all the vertices are repeated in both the rows and columns. An adjacency matrix can describe a directed graph, where the edges have a direction and point from one vertex to another. A one in the cell 3,4 means there is an edge from vertex three to vertex four.  If there is also a one in cell 4,3 then there is an edge pointing back from vertex four to vertex three. A matrix that has the same value for cell i,j and cell j,i is symetric.  It represents a directed graph that has edges pointing in both directions or an undirected graph, where the the edge direction doesn't matter  In the case of an undirected graph, we technically only need to record the upper (or lower) triangle since the matrix is symetric but we won't worry about that space efficiency concern in these examples.\n",

Both of the square 3x3 and 4x4 submatrices in the upper left and lower right are zero because there are no intra-set connections.  The 3x4 submatrix in the upper right quadrant, the position of \"B\" in this equation, directly contains our example relation R. (The \"B\" in this equation stands for \"Biadjacency martrix\" and is unrelated to name of our set \"B\" above).  The remaining 4x3 submatrix in the lower left quadrent is simply the transpose of relation.  This makes our adjaceny matrix symetric and implies the edges are bidirectional, or if we don't care about direction, undirected.\n",
