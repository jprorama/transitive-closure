    "We learn by discovering relationships between ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can document these connections using the notation of sets and recording the relations between items in those sets.\n",
    "Combining these relations can help us discover new connections between items. Combining relations is call relation composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can \"see\" relations by viewing them as a graph.\n",
    "In graph form, relations are treated as networks of connected nodes.\n",
    "The connections between items in the relation are visualized as edges between the nodes in the graph.\n",
    "Graphs allow us to visually explore connected items and discover new relationships by following the edges that make up the paths between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Relations\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, social networks contain many familiar relations like \"friend of\" and can be drawn as a graph where nodes represent people and edges between them represent their friendships.\n",
    "Another network we interact with every day is the World Wide Web.   Relations between web pages are defined by the hyperlinks between pages. The web can be visualized as a network called the web graph.  Here the web pages are nodes and the links between web pages are the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might also have data sets that describe two different relations between items and composing them could help discover secondary relationships.  For example, there are data sets that document drugs which are known to activate specific genes and other data sets that tells us which genes activate other genes. By composing these relations, we can discover drugs which could be investigated to activate genes indirectly through other genes.  This would give us a way to control genes that can't be directly controlled through known drug interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A Network of Friends\n",
    "Let's summarize these ideas with an example of a relation draw as a graph. It is a simple social network for the \"friends of\" relation between four imaginary people $\\{ a, b, c, d \\}$. We draw it using the [R's igraph library](https://igraph.org/r/doc/) and powerful plotting routines.  The nodes in the graph represent the people and the edges their \"friends of\" relation.  We can visually compose the \"friend of a friend\" transitive relation and discover that $(b,d)$ are members of that relation because $b$ is a \"friend of\" $c$ and $c$ is a \"friend of\" $d$."

    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a set of people $\\{ a, b, c, d \\}$ and know a parent-child relation, $R = \\{(a,b)\\}$,  and two sibling relations, $S=\\{(b,c),(b,d)\\}$, on that set.\n",
    "Given this information, we can compose, or compute, the relation of aunts or uncles between items in the set.\n",
    "That is we can deterime the composed relation $S \\circ R=\\{(a,c),(a,d)\\}$, which tells us that person $a$ is a \"nephew or neice of\" persons $c$ and $d$.\n",
    "Or conversly, that persons $c$ and $d$ are an \"aunt or uncle of\" person $a$.\n",
    "An aunt (or uncle) is a person who is a sibling of a parent.\n",
    "Therefore, if we know $a$ is a \"child of\" $b$, $aRb$, and $b$ is \"sibling of\" $c$ and $d$,  $bSc$ and $bSd$, then the composition of the relation, $R \\circ S$, tells us which people have aunt or uncle relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new, composed relation $S \\circ R$ defines a transitive relation.\n",
    "Transitive means if $a$ is related to $b$ and $b$ is related to $c$ then $a$ is also related to $c$.\n",
    "In other words, the connection between $a$ and $c$ transits across $b$.\n",
    "In graph terms, there is a path between $a$ and $c$ that passes through $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitive relationships can transit any number of intermediate items.\n",
    "For example, we could have a transitive relationship between $a$ and $d$ because we know relationships where $a$ is related to $b$, $b$ is related to $c$, and $c$ is related to $d$. In a graph, we would call that a path between $a$ and $d$ of length three.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitivity is a property of some relations. Not all relations are transitive. \n",
    "When a relation is transitive, however, it provides a powerful tool for discovering connections between items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transitive closure of a set contains all the relationships in a set that result from applying the transitive relation on the set.\n",
    "A closure is just the complete collection of all the relationships in which we are interested.\n",
    "The transitive closure can be computed by following all the connections between the nodes that are defined by the transitive relation, repeatedly applying the relation to the set until all pairs are documented.\n",
    "If we have a relation $R$, we can compute the transitive closure $R^*$, which is a new relation that contains the original relation and the complete collection of transitive relationships of any length between items in the set."

    "Relations can be conveniently represented as a matrix.\n",
    "The $n$ items in the set define the $n$ rows and $n$ columns of an $nxn$ matrix.\n",
    "The relation is represented by putting a one in the matrix entry $i,j$ if there is a relation between element $i$ and $j$ of the set and a zero if there is not.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's define a list to represent the items in our set $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$.  These are names of our people.  Defining them as a list makes it easier to use the names when we we create the matrix. Good labels make data easier to read."

The data is represented as a list of zeros and ones, where a one represents a relation between two items in our set.  We will read the entries by row to make the input list a little easier to read for those of us who read matrices in row-major order.  In this example, the second entry in the list will populate the cell in row $a$ and column $b$, meaning $a$ is a \"child of\" $b$."

    "Multiplying logical matrices makes easy work of composing new relations.\n",
    "Visualizing the new ideas represented by composed relations strengthens our understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we ask a machine to work for us, however, we need to be interested in, or concern ourselves with, the amount of work we are actually requesting it to carry out.\n",
    "Work on a computer is measured in instructions.\n",
    "The machine has to execute many instructions to accomplish the tasks we have set forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time it takes to carry out those instructions is governed by two factors.\n",
    "The raw speed of the computer as measured in cycles per second.\n",
    "Generally speaking, a computer can execute one instruction per cycle.\n",
    "Modern processors use pipelines to keep track of many instructions at a time, with the fastest ones able keep 32 or more instructions moving forward at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "With clock speeds around 3GHz and deep pipelines, we can expect our fastest processors to carry out as many as 100 billion instructions per second.\n",
    "The simpler the instruction the better, with addition being about as simple as it gets.\n",
    "Keep in mind that multiplication really represents repeated addition operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second factor affecting performance is how fast data can move through the processor.\n",
    "For a processor to add billions of numbers in a second, it needs to have billions of numbers arriving each second.\n",
    "When data isn't available, the processor starves.\n",
    "The cycles it executes go unused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making sure the data arrives in time involves planning.\n",
    "Most of that is managed by the processor itself.\n",
    "Fast data caches located directly on the processor hold on to the most frequently used data. \n",
    "There it can be moved around at processor speeds.\n",
    "Multiple cache layers work together to gather data from the relatively slow computer memory.\n",
    "Planning how computations are organized ensures data efficiently moves through the processor and avoids starvation."

    "## The Computational Cost of Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "So, is it practical to simply multiply matrices to compose relations or to compute the transitive closure?\n",
    "We might get away with a naive approach when data sets are small.\n",
    "Naive means brute force computation.\n",
    "Brute force computation carry out all the multiplication and addition instructions expected for standard matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying two $nxn$ matrices requires carring out $n^3$ operations; there are $n^2$ entries in an $nxn$ matrix and each entry is involved in $n$ multiply-add steps.\n",
    "Therefore, the naive algorithm for mulitiplying two matrices requires on the order of $nxnxn$ or $n^3$ operations.\n",
    "This approach is bounded by an $O(n^3)$ (read, [big-oh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) n-cubed) order computation.\n",
    "Additionally, the transitive closure requires $n-1$ matrix multiplications.\n",
    "This means a naive transitive closure computation is really bounded by an $O(n^4)$ order computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our data set is large we should avoid naive computation.\n",
    "Say we have 100 element set.\n",
    "A naive computation of transitive closure will require on the order of $100^4$ or 100 million operations.\n",
    "This is probably not too much to ask of a modern computer.\n",
    "But remember, the work increases exponentially for every factor of 10 increase in our set of elements.\n",
    "Data becomes big quickly at that rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1000 element set will take 1000 times longer than the 100 million operations it took for a 100 element set.\n",
    "This already accounts for all the instructions it is possible to run in one second on our fastest computers.\n",
    "Increase the data set by another factor of 10, and now we are waiting 15 minutes.\n",
    "A set with ten thousand items is not uncommon in an era of big data.\n",
    "At that scale, we can quickly run into significant wait times or, worse, choose to limit the amount of information from which we are willing to learn.\n",

    "The [Strassen algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm#Algorithm) partitions each of $A$, $B$ and $C$ into four equal sized block matrices.\n",
    "It then computes the blocks of $C$ using an arrangement of seven new matrices computed from the blocks of $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "This gets the work done using seven multiplication instead of the eight needed in a naive approach.\n",
    "Strassen was able to re-use overlapping sub-problems to reduce the workload.\n",
    "The approach demonstrated performance bounded by $O(n^{\\log_{2}7}) \\approx O(n^{2.8})$ instead of the $O(n^3)$ of a naive approach.\n",

    "## Shortest Paths in a Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "From the graph perspective of relations, we know that transitive relations are described by a path between nodes in a graph.\n",
    "We have been using the value of $1$ to record the existance an edge between nodes.\n",
    "In a graph, however, it is often very useful to use values other than $1$ to record an edge between nodes.\n",
    "These values are called weights.\n",
    "Weighted edges provide a measure for the quality of a connection between nodes.\n",
    "Values can be positive or negative.\n",
    "Their meaning depends completely on the problem domain modeled by the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common uses for weighted edges is to add the path weights and find a shortest path between connected nodes.\n",
    "For example, a weight of $1/2$ could describe a connection that is half-as-long as some other connection with a weight of $1$.\n",
    "In the simple case of relations, though, a value of $1$ is sufficient; a relation is a relation.\n",
    "No further qualification is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the following conversation, we can assume that all paths are positive.\n",

    "Additionally, if all weights in a graph are positive, the result of repeated multiplication of the adjacency matrix $M_R$ stabilizes at powers above $n-1$.\n",
    "This stability reflects the situation where the shortest path between two nodes can't be any longer than a path of $n-1$ edges, the maximum number of hops between two nodes.\n",

    "Squaring $M_R^2$ gives $M_R^4$.\n",
    "Repeating the squaring gives $M_R^8$, $M_R^{16}$, ..., $M_R^{\\lceil \\log_2(n-1) \\rceil}$.\n",
    "We arrive at the endpoint of our sequence within $\\log_2(n-1)$ matrix multiplication operations.\n",
