    "We might also have data sets that describe two different relations between items and composing them could help discover secondary relationships.  For example, there are data sets that document drugs which are known to activate specific genes and other data sets that tells us which genes activate other genes. By composing these relations, we can discover drugs which could be investigated to activate genes indirectly through other genes.  This would give us a way to control genes that can't be directly controlled through known drug interactions. \n",

We can visually compose the \"friend of a friend\" transitive relation and discover that $(b,d)$ are members of that relation because $b$ is a \"friend of\" $c$ and $c$ is a \"friend of\" $d$."

    "Since we are only interested in the existance of a relation, the only value ever needed in the result is a $1$, the presence of a relation.\n",

    "A binary matrix that maps elements of a set according to some relation is identical to an adjacency matrix for a graph.\n",
    "This means we can represent interesting graphs like social networks or maps of the web as adjacency matrix.\n",
    "We can then compute the transitive closure of these relations and find all nodes that are connected to each other either directly or through intermediate nodes.\n",
    "Limiting the path length, for example to two, would make easy work of determining who is connected by a friend-of-friends relation.\n",
    "This is a powerful tool for communitity detection in graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compute Considerations for Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "So, is it practical to just multiply the matrices together to compute the transitive closure?\n",
    "Whenever we do work on a computer we should be interested in, meaning concerned about, the amount of time it takes to do that work.\n",
    "If our data sizes are small, then we might get away with a naive approach for computing transitive closure.\n",
    "By naive we mean a brute force computation that does all the multiplication and addition steps you'd expect to do for matrix multiplication.\n",
    "Multiplying two nxn matrices means n^3 operations, so the naive approach is bounded by O(n^3).\n",
    "But since we have to do n of these matrix multiplications, that really works out to O(n^4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding of our data is too big depends on that computation decision.\n",
    "If we have 100 elements in our set, then a naive computation of transitive closure would be 100^4 or 100million operations.\n",
    "Probably not impossible to wait for, but it increases exponentially for every factor of 10 increase in our set of elements.\n",
    "Data becomes big pretty quickly at that rate.\n",
    "A one-thousand node network would take 1000 times longer than the 100million operations that it took for our 100 element set.\n",
    "This could quickly start to feel like waiting or, worse, limit the amount of information we are able to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "With social networks or the web graph we easily imagine thousands, millions or even billions of nodes in our network.\n",
    "Even if we are only interested in nodes connected by one or two intermediate nodes we are still bounded by O(n^3).\n",
    "The naive approach quickly becomes unmanagable at the scale of thousands of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1969 Strassen introduced the idea of fast matrix multiplication and was able to demonstrate performance bounded by O(n^(2.8)).\n",
    "These methods have been improved and the state of the art for fast matrix multiply is now about O(n^(2.373)).\n",
    "Keeping in mind that if we want the transitive closure we need still need to do this n times, bumping us above O(n^3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there faster methods?\n",
    "The well-known Floyd-Warshall algorithm for computing the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph can be applied to this problem.\n",
    "It runs in O(n^3), for n-node networks.\n",
    "We don't really care about weights for transitive closure, but finding the cheapest path is a nice feature to have in real world networks.\n",
    "Floyd-Warshall does this using a dynamic program technique to keep the computational bound at O(n^3).\n",
    "It inspects paths of increasing length between each node and keeps track of the shortest one.\n",
    "Inspecting each of the n^2 node pairs in the graph n times keeps it bound at at O(n^3).\n",
    "Because it finds the shortest path between all pairs, we end up with a complete set of paths across the graph at the end of the compution.\n",
    "That is we have the transitive closure in O(n^3) operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's revisit the earlier observation that we are working with binary matrices we can therefore use binary matrix multiplication.\n",
    "We replace the element-wise multiplication by Boolean AND operations and sum by OR operations.\n",
    "This means the value for a cell in the result matrix will be 1 if there is a 1 in any of the matching i,j and j,i cells.\n",
    "The Boolean OR operations means the result will be 1 if any one of these cell-level operations for the row and column multiplication is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite our left-side matrix of the multiplication as set of rows that just records the postion of the ones in that row.\n",
    "We then step through each element of these these i rows and inspect the corresponding element for its position k in the right side matrix in cell k,j.\n",
    "If the we find a 1 in that position then we know there is a path and set the value of the resulting cell to 1.\n",
    "We can then move on to the next row.\n",
    "The expected time for most matrices is O(n^2).\n",
    "There are worst case peformance of O(n^3) but that's not any worse than the solutions above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives use an O(n^2) algorithm for computing paths between nodes.\n",
    "This means we can compute a 1-million node network in same time it took us for computing a 1000 node network with our naive approach above.\n",
    "That's a huge increase in the size of networks we can explore.\n",
    "There's a log of value in thinking about perfomance when working with computers."
